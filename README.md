# Learning Python (AI-Oriented)

This repository contains Zahra's early exercises for learning Python.  
The goal is to build the foundations needed for AI and data analysis, step by step.

- `average_calculator.py`: Calculates average of a list of numbers entered by user.
- `student_class.py`: A basic class to represent student name and GPA.

## Next Steps

Coming soon:
- Data analysis with pandas
- Machine learning with scikit-learn
